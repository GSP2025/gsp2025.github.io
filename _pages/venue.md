#### How to get there

Mile-Ex is a dynamic neighborhood known for its mix of industrial charm and cutting-edge innovation. It's home to a thriving arts scene, excellent restaurants, and tech startups. It is also well-connected to the rest of the city via Montreal’s STM metro and bus system.

**Transit apps:** The STM-recommended transit apps are [Transit](https://transitapp.com/) and [Chrono](https://www.artm.quebec/en/chrono-mobile-application/), both are highly recommended. Transit has a nicer interface, but Chrono allows users to top-up their OPUS transit cards through the app. Google/Apple maps also work reasonably well.

**Montréal (YUL) airport to the city:** From the airport you can take the express 747 bus to downtown, and switch to metro/bus lines from there.
+ To arrive at the Mile-Ex neighborhood, the easiest way to go is to get off the 747 bus at the Lionel-Groulx metro station, and take the orange metro line to Beaubien/Jean-Talon stations.
+ You'll need an OPUS card for all modes of transport. You can either buy a 10-ride pass, or a multi-day or weekly pass. Note that transport to/from the airport requires an additional pass that is slightly more expensive, but is typically covered by the weekly pass. There is personnel by the ticket machines at the airport, so it's a good idea to check with them to make sure you're buying the right ticket if you have any doubts.

**Getting to Mila by public transport:** The nearest metro stations are De Castelnau (Blue line), Beaubien (Orange line) and Jean-Talon (both Blue and Orange lines), all a short 10-15-minute walk from the venue. You can also take the 55 bus from De Castelnau, 160/18 buses from Beaubien, and 92/31 buses from Jean-Talon to shorten the walk. Multiple other bus lines, including the very frequent 55 and 80, also serve the area.

**By taxi/rideshare/car:** Both taxis and rideshare services (Uber/Lyft) are readily available in Montreal. If you're driving yourself, do keep in mind that street parking in the surrounding area is available but limited.

**By bike:** Montreal is very bike-friendly, and [BIXI bike-sharing](https://bixi.com/en/) is very popular particularly in the warmer months with multiple stations available around Mila.

### Restaurants and bars

Delft boasts a diverse culinary landscape, thanks in part to its thriving international student community. Within the city center, conveniently located within walking distance from the campus or accessible via bus, we recommend a selection of restaurants to satisfy a range of tastes: 
+ "THUIS by Ladera": Immerse yourself in an authentic Dutch dining experience. Please make a reservation in advance, as it tends to fill up quickly. 
+ If you're in the mood for pizza, consider trying "Bas Sil," "San Marco," or "Il Peperoncino." 
+ Vegetarian or simply craving some veggie-focused cuisine? Head to "Hummus" or "The Harvest." 
+ Embark on a global culinary journey at "Mekhong Thai-Lao" (Thai) or "Redjeki" (Indonesian). 
+ For a cozy and inviting atmosphere with dishes inspired by far-flung locales such as South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Peru, and Sri Lanka, venture to "Hanno Groots Cafe."
