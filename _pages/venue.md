#### How to get there

Mile-Ex is a dynamic neighborhood known for its mix of industrial charm and cutting-edge innovation. It's home to a thriving arts scene, excellent restaurants, and tech startups. It is also well-connected to the rest of the city via Montreal’s STM metro and bus system.

**Transit apps:** The STM-recommended transit apps are [Transit](https://transitapp.com/) and [Chrono](https://www.artm.quebec/en/chrono-mobile-application/), both are highly recommended. Transit has a nicer interface, but Chrono allows users to top-up their OPUS transit cards through the app. Google/Apple maps also work reasonably well.

**Montréal (YUL) airport to the city:** From the airport you can take the express 747 bus to downtown, and switch to metro/bus lines from there.
+ To arrive at the Mile-Ex neighborhood, the easiest way to go is to get off the 747 bus at the Lionel-Groulx metro station, and take the orange metro line to Beaubien/Jean-Talon stations.
+ You'll need an OPUS card for all modes of transport. You can either buy a 10-ride pass, or a multi-day or weekly pass. Note that transport to/from the airport requires an additional pass that is slightly more expensive, but is typically covered by the multi-day/weekly/weekend passes. There is personnel by the ticket machines at the airport, so it's a good idea to check with them to make sure you're buying the right ticket if you have any doubts.

**Getting to Mila by public transport:** The nearest metro stations are De Castelnau (Blue line), Beaubien (Orange line) and Jean-Talon (both Blue and Orange lines), all a short 10-15-minute walk from the venue. You can also take the 55 bus from De Castelnau, 160/18 buses from Beaubien, and 92/31 buses from Jean-Talon to shorten the walk. Multiple other bus lines, including the very frequent 55 and 80, also serve the area.

**By taxi/rideshare/car:** Both taxis and rideshare services (Uber/Lyft) are readily available in Montreal. If you're driving yourself, do keep in mind that street parking in the surrounding area is available but limited.

**By bike:** Montreal is very bike-friendly, and [BIXI bike-sharing](https://bixi.com/en/) is very popular particularly in the warmer months with multiple stations available around Mila.

### Restaurants and bars

Delft boasts a diverse culinary landscape, thanks in part to its thriving international student community. Within the city center, conveniently located within walking distance from the campus or accessible via bus, we recommend a selection of restaurants to satisfy a range of tastes: 
+ "THUIS by Ladera": Immerse yourself in an authentic Dutch dining experience. Please make a reservation in advance, as it tends to fill up quickly. 
+ If you're in the mood for pizza, consider trying "Bas Sil," "San Marco," or "Il Peperoncino." 
+ Vegetarian or simply craving some veggie-focused cuisine? Head to "Hummus" or "The Harvest." 
+ Embark on a global culinary journey at "Mekhong Thai-Lao" (Thai) or "Redjeki" (Indonesian). 
+ For a cozy and inviting atmosphere with dishes inspired by far-flung locales such as South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Peru, and Sri Lanka, venture to "Hanno Groots Cafe."

### Sightseeing

+ Old Montréal contains the vast majority of historical buildings, most dating from the 17th - 19th century, the Notre-Dame Basilica, and many museums. There is also a 45 meter clock tower located in the Quai de l'Horloge, originally called the Victoria Pier, which you can climb up and get breathtaking views of the St. Laurence river and to a lesser extent, the city.
+ Mont-Royal is the extinct volcano the rises high above the city in the form of a large hill. The lookout at the top, known as the Belvédère, is a must-see, after walking through the Mont-Royal park.
+ Le Plateau/Mile End combines scenic residential streets, street art, mesmerizingly hip shopping, drinking and dining. The Mile End, an area of Le Plateau, offers some of the best drinking and dining in the city. It is just south of Mile-Ex, and thus easy to get to from Mila. Several streets are also pedestrianized during the summer months and are very pleasant to walk through.
+ Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is where the Olympic Stadium, Insectarium, Jardin Botanique, and Biodôme is located. Rue Ontario, between Pie-IX boulevard and Frontenac, becomes pedestrianized during the summer months and offers a glimpse into local culture, centering at Place Valois. Rue Adam and Rue La Fontaine (two streets down from Ontario), between avenue Morgan and rue Joliette, offer a plethora of quintessentially Montreal architectural styles. The Maisonneuve market is also there.
+ Downtown: Skyscrapers, McGill campus, churches, and museums.
+ Parc Jean-Drapeau, site of the 1967 World's Fair, now devoted to green spaces and a large outdoor concert venue. The Gilles Villeneuve racing circuit, home of the Montreal Formula 1 Grand Prix. An artificial beach, a huge outdoor pool complex and the Montreal Casino are also located on or around the park.
+ The Lachine Canal, just west of the old port, offers an interesting walk along a now defunct but sprawling industrial zone that has since been turned into an endless amount of condos. Walking here from Old Montreal is very doable, and brings you to the open air Atwater Market -- a Montreal favourite. The Canal also passes through the hip Saint Henri neighbourhood where some of Montreal's best restaurants can be found.
+ Saint Joseph's Oratory is Canada's largest church. It was built on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit which gives a stunning view of the city, especially at sunset.
