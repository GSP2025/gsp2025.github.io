#### Submission
We look forward to welcoming you to Lausanne to participate in this very stimulating workshop. We accept submission of **2-page extended abstracts**. Accepted contributions will be arranged in the format of oral or poster presentations. The workshop is a venue to share recent research results with **no published proceedings**. The workshop accepts submission of review papers if they are clearly identified as such.

#### Area of interest
A graph signal is a signal in which relationships between its components follows the structure encoded in a weighted graph. The purpose of graph signal processing is to exploit this underlying structure to analyze and process graph signals. The last few years have seen significant progress in the development of theory, tools, and applications of graph signal processing. The Graph Signal Processing Workshop is a forum intended to disseminate ideas to a broader audience and to exchange ideas and experiences on the future  path of this vibrant field.

Topics of interest include:

+ Sampling and recovery of graph signals
+ Graph filter and filter bank design
+ Uncertainty principles and other fundamental limits
+ Graph signal transforms
+ Graph filter identification
+ Graph topology inference
+ Statistical graph signal processing
+ Signal processing on in high-order graphs
+ Non-linear graph signal processing
+ Prediction and learning in graphs
+ Geometric deep learning (graph CNNs/RNNs)
+ Representation learning on graphs
+ Reinforcement learning on graphs
+ Applications to image and video processing
+ Applications to neuroscience and other medical fields
+ Applications to economics and social networks
+ Applications to infrastructure networks (e.g., communication, transportation, power networks)
