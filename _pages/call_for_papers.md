#### Area of interest
A graph signal is a signal in which relationships between its components follow the structure encoded in a weighted graph. The purpose of graph signal processing is to exploit this underlying structure to analyze and process graph signals. The last few years have seen significant progress in the development of theory, tools, and applications of graph signal processing. The Graph Signal Processing Workshop is a forum intended to disseminate ideas to a broader audience and to exchange ideas and experiences on the future path of this vibrant field.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

+ Sampling and recovery of graph signals
+ Graph filter and filter bank design
+ Uncertainty principles and other fundamental limits
+ Graph signal transforms
+ Graph filter identification
+ Graph topology inference
+ Statistical graph signal processing
+ Signal processing on higher-order networks
+ Non-linear graph signal processing
+ Prediction and learning in graphs
+ Geometric deep learning (graph CNNs/RNNs)
+ Representation learning on graphs
+ Reinforcement learning on graphs
+ Applications to image and video processing
+ Applications to neuroscience and other medical fields
+ Applications to economics and social networks
+ Applications to infrastructure networks (e.g., communication, transportation, power networks)
