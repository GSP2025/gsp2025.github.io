#### General Information

Lectures in the oral sessions are 20-minutes long (including Q&As). The format of posters is flexible, but A0 size and portrait orientation are recommended.

There will be a single poster session per day. The session takes place during two different time slots (13h00 to 14h00 and 15h00 to 16h00) but the posters will be the same.
